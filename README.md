# 4PAD - International Symposium on Formal Approaches to Parallel and Distributed Systems
The aim of 4PAD is to foster interaction between the formal methods communities and systems researchers working on topics in modern parallel, distributed, and network-based processing systems (e.g., autonomous computing systems, cloud computing systems, service-oriented systems and parallel computing architectures). 4PAD is typically co-located with international conferences on distributed computing. 

# Steering Committee

## Role
4PAD has a light-weight steering committe whose role is to appoint the chairs of the next edition and to ensure continuity of the spirit of the event.

## Composition policy
From 2014 to 2018 the steering committee was formed by the founders of the event. Starting from 2018, the steering committee of 4PAD has a new policy to promote renewal of the community and the topics: the steering committe is to be composed by the organisers (chairs) of the last 3 editions. Upon conclusion of edition N, the organisers of edition N join the steering committee and the two members that organised edition N-3 leave the committe. In the transition period from the old to the new policy the committee is composed by just 4 members.
